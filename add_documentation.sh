# Task Manager - Professional C Programming Project

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

### Core Programming Concepts
- **Modular Programming**: Clean separation of concerns across multiple modules
- **Memory Management**: Safe string handling and buffer management
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive input validation and error checking
- **File I/O**: Persistent data storage with proper file handling
- **Cross-Platform Code**: Conditional compilation for Windows/Unix systems

### Code Quality Practices
- **Consistent Naming**: Clear, descriptive variable and function names
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive comments explaining logic and purpose
- **Input Validation**: Robust handling of user input edge cases
- **Code Organization**: Logical file structure with proper header files
- **Build System**: Professional Makefile for compilation management

### Data Structures & Algorithms
- **Struct Design**: Well-defined Task structure for data organization
- **Array Management**: Dynamic task list with bounds checking
- **String Processing**: Safe string manipulation and validation
- **Search Algorithms**: Efficient task searching and filtering
- **Date Validation**: Custom date format validation logic

## Architecture Overview
```
